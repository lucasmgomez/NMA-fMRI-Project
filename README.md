# NMA fMRI Project - Time-domain decoding & Lateralization
This repository is for my Neuromatch Academy Pod's group project.

The entire project was built within one python notebook. As such, it is really simple to use; all run the cells!

Note: I recommend you use the notebook in google collab as all dependancys will be preinstalled.
